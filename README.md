i quickly realized it was tough finding the ages of tokens across the industry and didn't really want to pay for coignecko API ($130/month) this program scrapes the front end of coingecko, grabbing various 
data points from the token and outputs them as a dictionary in a txt file. from there, you're able to dissect and manipulate the data in ways that fit your bias. 

coingecko does change their html every so often, so this program may work for a limited time
